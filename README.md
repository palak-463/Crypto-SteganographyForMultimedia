# Crypto-Steganography For MultiMedia

A secure system that allows users to hide sensitive information within images and audio files, employing advanced cryptographic algorithms and steganographic techniques.

System Flow:
The user provides the data to be hidden and selects the type of media (image or audio) for embedding which is used as a carrier.
The user data is encrypted using strong cryptographic algorithms, such as AES for symmetric encryption, and then prepared for embedding.
Depending on the selected media type, appropriate steganographic techniques are applied; for images, algorithms like LSB or RLSB are used, while audio employs phase coding technique.
